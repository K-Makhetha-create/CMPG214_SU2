Reflection
Written communication in regards to clarity and conciseness
I found it challenging to simplify tech jargon to the point that people who are not IT profesinals can understand.
The original crisis communication failed beacuse the CEO couldn't understand the email that was sent to her due to it 
containing a lot of IT jargon of which she does not specialize in.
If this were a real I would simplify the language in which the email was written in and i would provide more context 
as to what happend.By doing so the chance of the CEO not understanding the severity of the crisis that we would be would 
reduced and measures to the reduce the impact of the attack could be taken in a timely manner.
